# To-do-list
A To do list web app using Flask concepts

Todo list manager
A personal todo list manager where you can maintain and schedule tasks for the
week. Strike them off as they're done, receive reminders when tasks are due and look
at an overall agenda for the week.
The following pieces of functionality are what’s expected. How and where you
implement them is upto you.
● Add task
● Schedule tasks
● View weekly schedule. Alert overdue tasks
● Mark tasks as done when you're done
If you’re able to implement a user authentication system do that multiple people can
use your application when it’s hosted, it will be a huge extra credit. For details on
how this is done, look at the flaskr tutotorial on the flask site to see how it
implements multiple user support. For user registration, you don’t need to
implement email or SMS confirmation. Just plain registration is sufficient.
